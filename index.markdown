  1. If you are unsure if you have registered to vote, please confirm. It takes less than a few minutes to do, and ensures that you are positioned to vote.

### Presidential Election Day: 11/3/2020

___

As important as the Presidential election is (and it is *very* important), take the time to <a href="https://www.usa.gov/election-office">research your congressional, state, and local elections as well</a>, in addition to specific legislation that is up for a vote in your area. The individuals you elect are the representatives and senators that deliver your voice to Washington, D.C. They are also responsible for countless decisions that affect your very own community, from education to public safety. 

### Congressional Elections

Congressional elections occur every two years. Voters choose one-third of senators and every member of the House of Representatives. Midterm elections occur halfway between presidential elections. The congressional elections in November 2018 were "midterms." Congressional elections use the popular vote to choose winners. They don't use the Electoral College, which is used in presidential elections.

*__U.S. House of Representatives__*: Members of the U.S. House of Representatives serve two-year terms. All 435 members get elected every midterm and presidential election year. A representative must be at least 25, a U.S. citizen for at least seven years, and live in the state he or she represents. The number of representatives a state has depends on its population. Each representative serves a specific congressional district. <a href="https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative">Find your representative</a>.

*__U.S. Senate__*: Senators serve six-year terms. One-third of senators get elected during each midterm and each presidential election year. A senator must be at least 30, a U.S. citizen for at least nine years, and live in the state he or she represents. There are 100 U.S. senators, two from each state. <a href="https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm">Find your senators</a>.
